Reflection 

	I struggled a lot with spaces, letters, and symbols. I did not realize how important everything was. Even if I make one small mistake with a symbol or space, it can become an error and the whole program would not run anymore. I believe that I should pay extra attention to every minute detail so that my program does not make any errors. 

 

Deeper Thinking 

	In my opinion, we would want to build strings, and then print out the results, than just printing out the results directly because of a couple reasons. One of the reasons is that we do not have to copy and paste the whole sentence or paragraph every time we want to print the same thing. Another reason is that we can make changes to our strings much easier than changing in each print function if we want to change something.
